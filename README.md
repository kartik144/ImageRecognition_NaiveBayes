# Image Recognition using Naive-Bayes Algorithm
## Recognition of Bitmap images using Naive Bayes Algorithm
This is an implemetation of Naive Bayes Algorithm for classification of images as faces.

The images were bitmap images of dimensions 70x60. The "facedatatrain" contains training data and "facedatatrainlabels" contains training labels.
The model was then tested on "facedatatest" dataset and the model gave an accuracy of 89.33%
